Before that, I studied philosophy.\r\n\r\nOn the philosophy side, I'm chiefly interested in metaphysics (ontology and mathematics/formal systems \u0026 semantics) and deontological ethics (praise and blame, moral education, honesty \u0026 bad faith).\r\n\r\nOn the computational side, I'm chiefly interested in program analysis, security, and systems programming. I do a decent amount of professional open source work on projects that encompass some of those.\r\n\r\nMy opinions are my own and do not reflect those of any employer, institutions, affiliates, lovers or haters past, present, or future. They might also not even be mine anymore!\r\n\r\nSites: yossarian.net / blog.yossarian.net / twitter.com/8x5clPW2","is_moderator":false,"karma":984,"avatar_url":"/avatars/yossarian-100.png","invited_by_user":"trent","github_username":"woodruffw","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"yossarian","sig_hash":"4fd3ae5c9de3d431a6081661b7db925f39596750774fac6a98a36ad05ef272810f"}]},"tags":["python","security"]},{"short_id":"wyeffq","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wyeffq","created_at":"2023-11-14T07:59:00.000-06:00","title":"A decade of developing a programming language","url":"https://yorickpeterse.com/articles/a-decade-of-developing-a-programming-language/","score":22,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wyeffq/decade_developing_programming_language","submitter_user":{"username":"andrewfromx","created_at":"2016-10-02T18:31:36.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewarrow","is_moderator":false,"karma":231,"avatar_url":"/avatars/andrewfromx-100.png","invited_by_user":"friendlysock"},"tags":["compilers"]},{"short_id":"mr1azy","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mr1azy","created_at":"2023-11-14T07:56:52.000-06:00","title":"Using JSX on the server as a template engine","url":"https://evertpot.com/jsx-template/","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mr1azy/using_jsx_on_server_as_template_engine","submitter_user":{"username":"evert","created_at":"2019-10-03T16:01:06.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://evertpot.com/","is_moderator":false,"karma":91,"avatar_url":"/avatars/evert-100.png","invited_by_user":"jjuran","twitter_username":"evertp"},"tags":["javascript","nodejs"]},{"short_id":"trv4iu","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/trv4iu","created_at":"2023-11-14T04:24:21.000-06:00","title":"Rust without crates.io","url":"https://thomask.sdf.org/blog/2023/11/14/rust-without-crates-io.html","score":22,"flags":0,"comment_count":19,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/trv4iu/rust_without_crates_io","submitter_user":{"username":"thombles","created_at":"2019-02-15T04:50:34.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"On the socials https://social.sdf.org/@thomask","is_moderator":false,"karma":1206,"avatar_url":"/avatars/thombles-100.png","invited_by_user":"calvin"},"tags":["rust"]},{"short_id":"upiyhx","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/upiyhx","created_at":"2023-11-14T04:09:34.000-06:00","title":"Four Kinds of Optimisation","url":"https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/2023/four_kinds_of_optimisation.html","score":16,"flags":0,"comment_count":5,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/upiyhx/four_kinds_optimisation","submitter_user":{"username":"ltratt","created_at":"2019-08-15T07:35:48.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://tratt.net/laurie/","is_moderator":false,"karma":729,"avatar_url":"/avatars/ltratt-100.png","invited_by_user":"edd"},"tags":["performance"]},{"short_id":"2qepkn","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/2qepkn","created_at":"2023-11-14T03:09:24.000-06:00","title":"CHERI-picking: Leveraging capability hardware for prefetching","url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3623759.3624553","score":10,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/2qepkn/cheri_picking_leveraging_capability","submitter_user":{"username":"david_chisnall","created_at":"2020-03-19T12:44:25.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I am a former Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Cambridge and a Visiting Researcher at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, working on hardware/software co-design for cloud security.
