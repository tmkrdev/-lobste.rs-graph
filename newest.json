Our compiler targets RISC-V “V” vector instruction set extension, is built upon WebAssembly technology, and can support all C standard library functions that are required for a 3D path tracer application to function.  \r\nWe compiled three test programs using our compiler. One of them is a path tracer program. We prove that our compiler can perform outer loop vectorization eﬀiciently, also reduce the diﬀiculty of vector and SIMD programming.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/7co7g0/outer_loop_vectorization_simt_approach","submitter_user":{"username":"dbremner","created_at":"2012-09-06T19:01:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"C, C++, C#, and recently Python, Swift, and Objective-C.  \r\nLearning Scala.","is_moderator":false,"karma":3161,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dbremner-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx","github_username":"dbremner"},"tags":["compilers","pdf"]},{"short_id":"m0u8ej","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/m0u8ej","created_at":"2023-10-16T09:06:47.000-05:00","title":"API design principle: Reading a property or adding an event handler should not alter observable behavior","url":"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20231016-00/?p=108895","score":11,"flags":0,"comment_count":5,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/m0u8ej/api_design_principle_reading_property","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":99790,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["api"]},{"short_id":"asr640","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/asr640","created_at":"2023-10-16T08:52:03.000-05:00","title":"uniseg: Unicode Text Segmentation, Word Wrapping, and String Width Calculation in Go","url":"https://github.com/rivo/uniseg","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/asr640/uniseg_unicode_text_segmentation_word","submitter_user":{"username":"fs111","created_at":"2017-01-04T07:51:28.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":5765,"avatar_url":"/avatars/fs111-100.png","invited_by_user":"drdoom","github_username":"fs111","twitter_username":"fs111"},"tags":["go"]},{"short_id":"m4mzyx","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/m4mzyx","created_at":"2023-10-16T08:42:30.000-05:00","title":"Better HTTP server routing in Go 1.22","url":"https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2023/better-http-server-routing-in-go-122/","score":37,"flags":0,"comment_count":4,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/m4mzyx/better_http_server_routing_go_1_22","submitter_user":{"username":"icy","created_at":"2019-03-22T08:39:08.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"[@icy@icyphox.sh](https://h.icyphox.sh/@icy) on the fedi\r\n\r\nhelsinki, finland","is_moderator":false,"karma":2672,"avatar_url":"/avatars/icy-100.png","invited_by_user":"romanzolotarev","github_username":"icyphox"},"tags":["go"]}]
