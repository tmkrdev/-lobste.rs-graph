This opened up a whole other can of worms… first of all, I couldn’t tell that PXE not working was because of the system firmware at first, but once I figured that out, I had to figure out Windows Deployment Services (WDS) and Remote Installation Services (RIS).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst I tried a Server 2003 R2 install server, but then after seeing it spit out 2462 and 3590 I learned that WDS in 2003 R2 is basically the Server 2008 version retrofitted into 2K3 R2. Eventually I landed on Server 2003 (non-R2) SP2, which has WDS but the legacy RIS is actually okay with 2462 and 3590. I was able to import 3590 okay, but 2462 had issues. When the system went to copy the files from the install media, I’d get a “The system cannot find the file specified” error, and the error titlebar indicated it was looking under the root of the media for ‘lang*’. Strange, because the lang folder would be under an architecture’s folder on the media (i386 and ia64). I didn’t think it would work, but I tried just copying the ia64\\lang folder to the root, which got a lot further but then led me to an error about c2.bin/e100bnt5.sys. Tripredacus on MSFN suggested using procmon (Process Monitor) from SysInternals to trace what the RIS Setup was doing, which was a great help. Like I said, not a Windows person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last version of procmon.exe/SysInternals that seems to run on this era of Windows is 3.10.

The AdditionalClientDirs seems to tell RIS what other folders to grab installation files from. I changed it to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e[AdditionalClientDirs]\nia64\\lang\nia64\\asms\ni386\\asms\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom just \u003ccode\u003elang\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003easms\u003c/code\u003e. I guessed what to actually put based on the contents of reminst.inf from 3590. This got me back to the e100bnt5.sys error. I looked inside the media, and found no e100bnt5.sys, nor e100bnt5.sy_ (sy_ indicating a compressed Microsoft cabinet containing just e100bnt5.sys). Turns out, there’s a big cabinet called driver.cab under ia64, which contained a bunch of driver files (you guessed it!), but still no e100bnt5.sys. However, there was an e100w64.sys. My guess is that the driver got renamed during XP 64-bit/2K3 64-bit development, but not all of this build got the memo. I tried editing layout.inf (also plays a part in laying out the files needed to be copied for RIS installs, as far as I can tell) and txtsetup.inf to remove all references to e100bnt5.sys, but this didn’t help. I’m guessing the c2.bin file that shows in the RIS copy window at this error somehow has a hard dependency on e100bnt5.sys being there or something somehow, I took a quick look in a hex editor but didn’t find anything. I decided to just copy e100w64.sys to e100bnt5.sys in the driver cab, but this didn’t end up being straightforward either! Windows comes with \u003ccode\u003emakecab.exe\u003c/code\u003e, which will make cabinet files for you, but it has weird defaults such as only making floppy-ish sized cabs by default.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I landed on:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCopying all of the contents of the original driver.cab to a path with no spaces (I used C:\\DriverCab).
