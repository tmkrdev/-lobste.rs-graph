I've tried a few, I think I'd like something that has a REPL or notebook interface as well as or instead of a file-based interface.\r\n\r\nHere are some I've tried:\r\n\r\nUsing a general-purpose programming language:\r\n\r\n- [bitburner](https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/) - this is quite fun, though there's quite a lot going on\r\n- [hackmud](https://www.hackmud.com/) - this seems fun and interesting, though the community is small now. This was my introduction to JS dependency hell.\r\n\r\nSpecial purpose languages:\r\n\r\n- The many Zach-likes - I've enjoyed these a lot, but I want something a bit more open than puzzle-y\r\n- Else.heart.break - This was quite fun, but a very slow start and then I broke the quest triggers by skipping right to the end of the game once I got the hacking device.\r\n- [colobot](https://colobot.info/) a cool classic educational programming game where you're an astronaut controlling lots of robots - I remember the missions feeling a lot easier to solve without much programming, but apparently there's a new mission pack...\r\n\r\nAnyway! Interested to hear your recommendations!","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/i6e0xg/do_you_know_any_good_programming_games","submitter_user":{"username":"cmcaine","created_at":"2019-07-15T10:38:01.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Apprenticing scientist.\r\n\r\nCo-founding developer of Tridactyl, a popular vim-like interface to Firefox.","is_moderator":false,"karma":1570,"avatar_url":"/avatars/cmcaine-100.png","invited_by_user":"bovine3dom","github_username":"cmcaine","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"cmcaine","sig_hash":"93c29ff925d114ffbf761194337b7fc7fce40c58e7d0bf9b742cdd4978af47620f"}]},"tags":["ask","games"]},{"short_id":"bagmec","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bagmec","created_at":"2022-10-18T06:39:06.000-05:00","title":"Difftastic diffing with Magit","url":"https://tsdh.org/posts/2022-08-01-difftastic-diffing-with-magit.html","score":26,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bagmec/difftastic_diffing_with_magit","submitter_user":{"username":"itamarst","created_at":"2016-04-28T10:05:47.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Writing about Python performance and faster development at https://pythonspeed.com, as well as offering consulting services.
