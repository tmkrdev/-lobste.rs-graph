Unlike rqlite which will require you to talk to single master node, or litestream requiring some sort of periodic DB restore mechanism, each node will just talk to the other node and replicate the change. \r\n\r\n## Have you used it?\r\n\r\nI've been using this on a pretty high traffic, read heavy website now for few weeks now as I developed features on Marmot (with 1 of node restarting and seamlessly catching up to all the changes). While it's too early, I will like to open it up to community, and see if somebody will be willing to try and help me improve documentation, and fix issues. \r\n\r\n## Code and Download\r\n\r\nYou can get checkout [source code here](https://github.com/maxpert/marmot) or directly download [latest version](https://github.com/maxpert/marmot/releases/tag/v0.3.1). As I continue to improve, and features like copy all rows on boot before joining cluster, and control panel; I would love to hear stories on if you are able to use it successfully in production (Please use it for ephemeral storage scenarios first to get comfortable).","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/f9slcf/marmot_distributed_sqlite_replication","submitter_user":{"username":"mxp","created_at":"2015-12-27T09:43:55.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":321,"avatar_url":"/avatars/mxp-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx"},"tags":["databases"]},{"short_id":"4qrc57","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/4qrc57","created_at":"2022-09-08T08:03:53.000-05:00","title":"The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Logical Verification","url":"https://browncs1951x.github.io/static/files/hitchhikersguide.pdf","score":15,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/4qrc57/hitchhiker_s_guide_logical_verification","submitter_user":{"username":"jakob","created_at":"2018-03-02T15:45:42.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Website: \u003chttp://jakob.space\u003e\r\n\r\nMastodon: \u003chttps://mastodon.sdf.org/@jakob\u003e","is_moderator":false,"karma":764,"avatar_url":"/avatars/jakob-100.png","invited_by_user":"calvin","github_username":"TsarFox"},"tags":["formalmethods","math","pdf"]},{"short_id":"jdyknf","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/jdyknf","created_at":"2022-09-08T01:30:25.000-05:00","title":"Compiling a Million Lines of Code with Delphi","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq2mNUzcpE0","score":5,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/jdyknf/compiling_million_lines_code_with_delphi","submitter_user":{"username":"Peter5","created_at":"2022-08-31T09:25:20.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":75,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Peter5-100.png","invited_by_user":"Walterion"},"tags":["compilers","performance","video"]}]
