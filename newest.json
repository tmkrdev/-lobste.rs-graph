Of course, I've spent thousands of hours programming by myself, but I'm facing the reality that I am just not an introvert, even if I'm working solo, I'm more motivated when I know there is another programmer on the project who I can share my code with.\r\n\r\nI've brought this realization into my writing and cartooning, and it's worked out amazingly. Working with co-writers brings out the best of my creativity and writing ability.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have ideas about finding other extroverted programmers?\r\n\r\nOf course, I'm getting started by posting here. And please let me know if you'd like to meet up and write some code.\r\n\r\nI'm brainstorming ideas:\r\n- publish a website about my ideas for social programming and inviting people to join me\r\n- write about pair programming and collaboration plans (so people know what to expect)\r\n- publish notes/diaries from pair programming sessions\r\n- easy/fun projects to work on just for fun with new people (Game of Life, Snake, Todo app, etc.)\r\n- agree that we want to practice specific skills or try to follow a specific process\r\n- e.g. if both agree, start with a Daniel Jackson style concept design and then refine into actual code (or other design processes, sequence diagrams, data models, etc.)\r\n- independently create prototypes and then read code together and get feedback \r\n- publish a list of projects I'd like to work on and invite interested people to contact me\r\n- we need more real-time video chat platforms that are not creepy and facilitate interesting group conversations\r\n- look for people locally, IRL\r\n\r\n...side idea, I'm just gonna put it here since this post is already kind of a mess: imagine a video chat site where you can choose a general topic or specific debate or specific lecture topic, then join that room and it is auto-moderated in some ways such as the open mic rotates, you get a fixed time before the mic automatically moves to the next speaker, the audience can kick/mute by consensus (e.g. if some is offensive/spam), the audience can vote and have text chat (e.g. if it's a debate or there can be polls, people can summarize main points provided by speakers), some rooms can just be shooting the shit, like open mic comedy rooms, discussing movies/books, etc.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnyway, any ideas on finding programmers to collaborate with?\r\ntuations","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/blidu7/finding_extroverted_programmers_for","submitter_user":{"username":"mdashx","created_at":"2020-12-12T09:35:41.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://www.mdashx.com - personal homepage\r\n\r\nhttps://www.tomhyndman.com - professional homepage","is_moderator":false,"karma":48,"avatar_url":"/avatars/mdashx-100.png","invited_by_user":"unworriedsafari"},"user_is_author":true,"tags":["culture","practices"]},{"short_id":"vcbixd","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vcbixd","created_at":"2024-01-22T07:39:15.000-06:00","title":"Trunk-Based Development","url":"https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/","score":22,"flags":1,"comment_count":13,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vcbixd/trunk_based_development","submitter_user":{"username":"DLion","created_at":"2023-05-05T04:47:50.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":21,"avatar_url":"/avatars/DLion-100.png","invited_by_user":"uncle_kras","github_username":"dlion","twitter_username":"DLion92"},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["programming","vcs"]},{"short_id":"rku8kf","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/rku8kf","created_at":"2024-01-22T05:34:11.000-06:00","title":"Practical KaiOS Optimization Tips","url":"https://kaios.dev/2024/01/practical-kaios-optimization-tips/","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/rku8kf/practical_kaios_optimization_tips","submitter_user":{"username":"toastal","created_at":"2021-07-12T04:15:50.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"a disciple of functional programming\r\n\r\nStop using Microsoft products; say _NO_ to neo-EEE including Windows, WSL, GitHub, Sponsors, Copilot, VS Code, Codespaces, Azure, npm, Teams","is_moderator":false,"karma":3758,"avatar_url":"/avatars/toastal-100.png","invited_by_user":"gerikson","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"toastal","sig_hash":"be4ea8b4b314c4342e5dd97f1d845cc8586de0b0ec40ab4cd872f31071eab6030f"}]},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["javascript","mobile","performance"]},{"short_id":"slhe5j","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/slhe5j","created_at":"2024-01-22T02:26:30.000-06:00","title":"How Jane Street Does Code Review (2017)","url":"https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/janestreet-code-review/","score":11,"flags":0,"comment_count":14,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/slhe5j/how_jane_street_does_code_review_2017","submitter_user":{"username":"rtpg","created_at":"2016-07-06T05:00:24.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Freelance developer.
