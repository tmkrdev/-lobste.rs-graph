It's a technical drawing of a cutaway Ferrari F40 and was created by Dave Rumfelt using Deneba Canvas whilst he was working at Deneba Systems. These names might trigger some fond memories for Macintosh users. \r\n\r\nThe illustration was based on an earlier physical/airbrushed illustration by David A. Kimble, who is known for his cutaway car illustrations and also some Star Trek blueprints. \r\n\r\nOn my blog post I've also added embedded screen recording of me zooming into the illustration, and a recently exported 20-megapixel scrollable version.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gbbeth/famous_f40_vector_illustration","submitter_user":{"username":"gingerbeardman","created_at":"2023-07-31T22:23:44.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Games for Playdate. 1-bit Woodblocks.
