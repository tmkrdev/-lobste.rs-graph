This is part of my ongoing effort to document various parsing algorithms including [GLL](https://rahul.gopinath.org/post/2022/07/02/generalized-ll-parser/), [Earley](https://rahul.gopinath.org/post/2021/02/06/earley-parsing/), [PEG](https://rahul.gopinath.org/post/2018/09/06/peg-parsing/), and [Parsing Combinators](https://rahul.gopinath.org/post/2020/03/02/combinatory-parsing/).\r\n\r\nI am looking for feedback on structure as well as content as before. The implementation prioritizes clarity over speed.\r\n\r\nNote: Pyodide takes a little time to initialize, but it should be faster to initialize than spinning up the binder service from Jupyter (but slower to execute).","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xfkru3/valiant_s_general_context_free_parser","submitter_user":{"username":"vrthra","created_at":"2016-05-03T17:32:26.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Lecturer (equivalent to an assistant prof. in the U.S.) at the University of Sydney\r\n\r\n(I usually only browse lobste.rs and other social media on weekends.
