Masking countermeasures can usually be integrated into the software during the design phase. In theory, this should provide reliable protection against such physical attacks. However, the correct application of masking is a non-trivial task which often causes even experts to make mistakes. In addition to human-caused errors, micro-architectural CPU effects can lead even a seemingly theoretically correct implementation to fail satisfying the desired level of security in practice. This originates from different components of the underlying CPU which complicates the tracing of leakage back to a particular source and hence avoids to make general and device-independent statements about its security.\nIn this work, we adapt PROLEAD for the evaluation of masked software, which has recently been presented at CHES 2022 and originally developed as a simulation-based tool to evaluate masked hardware designs.\nWe enable to transfer the already known benefits of PROLEAD into the software world. These include (1) evaluation of larger designs compared to the state of the art, e.g. a full AES masked implementation, and (2) formal verification under the well-established robust probing security model. In short, together with an abstraction model for the micro-architecture, the robust probing model allows us to efficiently detect micro-architectural leakages while being independent of a concrete CPU design.

Kildaire (or deavmi on the Internet) and I‚Äôm a computer programmer. I love tinkering around with all the bits of software that my computer runs but typically more on the low-level sides of things. I‚Äôm really interested in how operating systems work as a whole and their components such as kernels, networking stacks, linking-loaders, IPC, paging, virtual memory, file-systems and the list goes on. There‚Äôs so much to learn from understanding these complex systems and each aspect of them never leaves me bored!\r\n\r\nYou could call me a language enthusiast, from the design to the implementation. I always want to know how things work and I‚Äôve even spent time reading the source code for some language runtimes to get a better understanding. If I am feeling creative then I try write my own or write something in Forth! I love building networks too - I have an interest in setting up inter-networks with routing protocols, assigning numbers and setting up tunnels in order to build a huge network that I can play around on. When I‚Äôm not using other peoples' protocols I am busy writing my own to see what I can cobble out to itch my scratch on trying interesting concepts out.\r\n\r\nI like a good glass of red wine and cheese. I have an avid enjoyment for music from the 70s and the 80s and have rather interesting political views (nothing to be alarmed of) but most importantly I like to help others learn and put a smile on their face.","is_moderator":false,"karma":139,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deavmi-100.png","invited_by_user":"duclare","github_username":"deavmi","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"tristankildaire","sig_hash":"4397ec164f1a65b7fd0803bc85cd0b12d06cb2606c2ae0a27795dd90e98e219c0f"}]},"tags":["programming","video"]},{"short_id":"ct1u0s","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ct1u0s","created_at":"2023-01-20T09:51:00.000-06:00","title":"Space
