Here's a gif showing the autocompletion: https://thin.dev/startpage/autocomplete30.gif\r\n\r\nTo simplify state management (which is typically hard and lot's of boilerplate), we provide realtime APIs so that all app state is always in sync with the actual database. Previously your react app might have been rendered from the redux state, now it's rendered directly from the server state.\r\n\r\nThin actually makes the new database records etc. visible already even before the server has responded (that's meant with optimistic updates). This allows for a super fast user experience even when there's a couple 100ms's of network latency.\r\n\r\nHere‚Äôs an example of a simple todo list app built with Thin + React:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction Tasks() {\r\n    const tasks = useQuery(query('tasks').orderBy('createdAt'));\r\n\r\n    return \u003cdiv\u003e\r\n        {tasks.map(task =\u003e \u003cTask task={task} key={task.id} /\u003e)}\r\n\r\n        \u003cNewTaskButton /\u003e\r\n    \u003c/div\u003e\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Task({ task }) {\r\n    const editTask = () =\u003e {\r\n        updateRecord('tasks', task.id, {\r\n            title: window.prompt('Enter new title') || ''\r\n        })\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    return \u003cdiv onDoubleClick={editTask}\u003e\r\n        {task.title}\r\n    \u003c/div\u003e\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction NewTaskButton() {\r\n    const addTask = () =\u003e {\r\n        createRecord('tasks', {\r\n            title: window.prompt('Enter title') || ''\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return \u003cbutton onClick={addTask}\u003eAdd Task\u003c/button\u003e\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Schema Designer and the migration tools make it really easy to get going with a project.\r\n\r\nInternally Thin is built with Haskell and powered by IHP DataSync (https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/realtime-spas.html).\r\n\r\nYou can find thin on github here https://github.com/digitallyinduced/thin-backend and at http://thin.dev/\r\n\r\nHappy to hear everyone's feedback! :)","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/scs239/thin_dev_back_end_for_making_end_end","submitter_user":{"username":"mpscholten","created_at":"2020-06-23T02:15:25.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":72,"avatar_url":"/avatars/mpscholten-100.png","invited_by_user":"hendi","github_username":"mpscholten"},"tags":["api","web"]},{"short_id":"kjhwct","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/kjhwct","created_at":"2022-05-12T02:16:03.000-05:00","title":"Drizzle: the most influential software project you‚Äôve (probably) never heard of","url":"https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2022/05/10/drizzle/","score":18,"flags":0,"comment_count":10,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/kjhwct/drizzle_most_influential_software","submitter_user":{"username":"Mordo","created_at":"2015-01-29T02:48:41.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":587,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Mordo-100.png","invited_by_user":"bobbywilson0","twitter_username":"JordiMonPMM"},"tags":["practices"]},{"short_id":"ucjlun","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ucjlun","created_at":"2022-05-12T01:17:04.000-05:00","title":"Matrix Rust SDK 0.5 brings native crypto, wasm support","url":"https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-0.5.0","score":8,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ucjlun/matrix_rust_sdk_0_5_brings_native_crypto","submitter_user":{"username":"gnunicorn","created_at":"2015-03-02T06:01:13.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Freelance Software Architect, Developer and Educator.
