They exploit the vulnerability of speculative execution to illegally access private data, and transmit them through timing-based covert channels. While new vulnerabilities are discovered continuously, the covert channels can be categorised to two types: 1) Persistent Type, in which covert channels are based on the layout changes of buffering, e.g. through caches or TLBs; 2) Volatile Type, in which covert channels are based on the contention of sharing resources, e.g. through execution units or issuing ports. The defenses against the persistent-type covert channels have been well addressed, while those for the volatile-type are still rather inadequate.
