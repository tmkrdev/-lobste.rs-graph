Before that, I studied philosophy.\r\n\r\nOn the philosophy side, I'm chiefly interested in metaphysics (ontology and mathematics/formal systems \u0026 semantics) and deontological ethics (praise and blame, moral education, honesty \u0026 bad faith).\r\n\r\nOn the computational side, I'm chiefly interested in program analysis, security, and systems programming. I do a decent amount of professional open source work on projects that encompass some of those.\r\n\r\nMy opinions are my own and do not reflect those of any employer, institutions, affiliates, lovers or haters past, present, or future. They might also not even be mine anymore!\r\n\r\nSites: yossarian.net / blog.yossarian.net / twitter.com/8x5clPW2\r\n\r\n[ my public key: https://keybase.io/yossarian; my proof: https://keybase.io/yossarian/sigs/Rv6e3jLOTzYa5MqFuXV0hnLoYT7xTVeyHjwluVuZTX8 ]","is_moderator":false,"karma":765,"avatar_url":"/avatars/yossarian-100.png","invited_by_user":"trent","github_username":"woodruffw","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"yossarian","sig_hash":"4fd3ae5c9de3d431a6081661b7db925f39596750774fac6a98a36ad05ef272810f"}]},"tags":["python","security"]},{"short_id":"wzvnnr","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wzvnnr","created_at":"2023-04-20T23:28:46.000-05:00","title":"Asynchronous Programming in Python with asyncio","url":"https://muhammadraza.me/2023/Asynchronous-Programming-in-Python/","score":9,"flags":0,"comment_count":8,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wzvnnr/asynchronous_programming_python_with","submitter_user":{"username":"mraza007","created_at":"2019-11-01T11:53:44.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":836,"avatar_url":"/avatars/mraza007-100.png","invited_by_user":"rkeene","github_username":"mraza007","twitter_username":"muhammad_o7"},"tags":["programming","python"]},{"short_id":"vjqxgx","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vjqxgx","created_at":"2023-04-20T23:15:22.000-05:00","title":"Standardizing BPF","url":"https://lwn.net/Articles/926882/","score":9,"flags":0,"comment_count":3,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vjqxgx/standardizing_bpf","submitter_user":{"username":"jmillikin","created_at":"2021-07-22T09:39:26.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Currently semi-retired; formerly at Google (2011-2017) and Stripe (2017-2022)","is_moderator":false,"karma":1393,"avatar_url":"/avatars/jmillikin-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx"},"tags":["linux"]},{"short_id":"ld8b6q","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ld8b6q","created_at":"2023-04-20T22:59:21.000-05:00","title":"Emacs Comes to Android","url":"https://irreal.org/blog/?p=11144","score":11,"flags":0,"comment_count":4,"description":"\u003cp\u003eVersions newer than on F-Droid are available on \u003ca href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs/files/\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eSourceForge\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe technical information about the port can be found in \u003ca href=\"https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/java/README?h=feature/android\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ethe port‚Äôs branch in Emacs source code\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","description_plain":"Versions newer than on F-Droid are available on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs/files/)\r\n\r\nThe technical information about the port can be found in [the port's branch in Emacs source code](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/java/README?h=feature/android)","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ld8b6q/emacs_comes_android","submitter_user":{"username":"yardanico","created_at":"2023-04-20T21:53:02.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Doing things in Nim","is_moderator":false,"karma":11,"avatar_url":"/avatars/yardanico-100.png","invited_by_user":"imode","github_username":"Yardanico"},"tags":["android","emacs","release"]}]
