These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description_plain":"Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.
