I'm John. I'm a computer programmer from Australia with over 20 years commercial experience. I used to be a C# programmer in the Microsoft world but about 10 years ago I jumped ship and now I program mostly on the LAMP stack. I consider programming my craft and I endeavour to be as good at it as I possibly can be.","is_moderator":false,"karma":84,"avatar_url":"/avatars/jj5-100.png","invited_by_user":"gerikson","github_username":"jj5"},"tags":["hardware","historical","video"]},{"short_id":"mqwigo","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mqwigo","created_at":"2022-10-14T04:40:23.000-05:00","title":"Zero Feet: a proposal for a systems-free Lisp","url":"https://applied-langua.ge/posts/zero-feet.html","score":13,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mqwigo/zero_feet_proposal_for_systems_free_lisp","submitter_user":{"username":"gerikson","created_at":"2017-01-13T03:16:10.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://gerikson.com/hnlo/\r\n\r\n@gerikson@mastodon.social\r\n","is_moderator":false,"karma":13206,"avatar_url":"/avatars/gerikson-100.png","invited_by_user":"varjag","github_username":"gustafe"},"tags":["lisp"]},{"short_id":"c56ik2","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/c56ik2","created_at":"2022-10-14T03:26:26.000-05:00","title":"What are you doing this weekend?","url":"","score":11,"flags":1,"comment_count":13,"description":"\u003cp\u003eFeel free to tell what you plan on doing this weekend and even ask for help or feedback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease keep in mind it’s more than OK to do nothing at all too!\u003c/p\u003e\n","description_plain":"Feel free to tell what you plan on doing this weekend and even ask for help or feedback.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind it’s more than OK to do nothing at all too!","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/c56ik2/what_are_you_doing_this_weekend","submitter_user":{"username":"caius","created_at":"2014-05-13T06:58:30.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Compulsive Geek, Ale Connoisseur, Occasionally Responsible Adult.","is_moderator":false,"karma":8158,"avatar_url":"/avatars/caius-100.png","invited_by_user":"lauris","github_username":"caius","twitter_username":"Caius"},"tags":["ask","programming"]},{"short_id":"jkq66o","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/jkq66o","created_at":"2022-10-14T02:58:11.000-05:00","title":"Prusti: Static Analyzer for Rust","url":"https://github.com/viperproject/prusti-dev","score":5,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/jkq66o/prusti_static_analyzer_for_rust","submitter_user":{"username":"tankf33der","created_at":"2017-06-07T13:06:59.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":397,"avatar_url":"/avatars/tankf33der-100.png","invited_by_user":"james"},"tags":["programming","rust"]},{"short_id":"n7pk2c","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/n7pk2c","created_at":"2022-10-14T01:52:40.000-05:00","title":"Voodoo2: 3dfx's final dedicated 3d gaming card","url":"https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/voodoo2-3dfxs-final-dedicated-3d-gaming-card/","score":18,"flags":0,"comment_count":7,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/n7pk2c/voodoo2_3dfx_s_final_dedicated_3d_gaming","submitter_user":{"username":"Tenzer","created_at":"2019-06-24T12:19:29.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":961,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Tenzer-100.png","invited_by_user":"jamesog"},"tags":["hardware","historical"]},{"short_id":"qytdxl","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/qytdxl","created_at":"2022-10-14T01:41:39.000-05:00","title":"A Modern Fortran Scientific Programming Ecosystem","url":"https://degenerateconic.com/a-modern-fortran-scientific-programming-ecosystem.html","score":5,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/qytdxl/modern_fortran_scientific_programming","submitter_user":{"username":"knl","created_at":"2017-07-21T07:12:24.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Senior software engineer specialized in distributed systems and low latency, high frequency trading infrastructure.","is_moderator":false,"karma":5578,"avatar_url":"/avatars/knl-100.png","invited_by_user":"james","github_username":"knl","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"knl","sig_hash":"cb1fe17fead6d360f9abca902132b2407ee736f1a243f615ad9757dfe8d17e3b0f"}]},"tags":["fortran"]},{"short_id":"dbxet4","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/dbxet4","created_at":"2022-10-14T00:16:23.000-05:00","title":"Hardware, Software, Education Setup","url":"https://dev.to/p10q/fresh-computer-setup-5flm","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"\u003cp\u003eRecently re-imaged a laptop.
