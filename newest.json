I have been at the company for the majority of my career and spent my time moving up in roles that were _likely_ created to encompass the work I was doing. I never discussed with my previous manager about what a career roadmap looked like and mostly just did my job and kept solving my problems and taking promotions.\r\n\r\nI moved into a leadership role (title: _Lead Software Developer_) about two years ago, and last year my old boss had left the company - leaving the GM to tap me to take on the responsibilities of running the team.\r\n\r\nI have been loving the job but one of the big concerns I have is that I _do not_ know how to provide good guidance or structure for career growth within my team. Because of this, I am asking you - **how are your teams structured and what paths for career growth do you have at your company?**\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/sfoo81/how_are_your_teams_structured","submitter_user":{"username":"dsh","created_at":"2016-04-08T10:38:09.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Father, developer, producer, photographer.","is_moderator":false,"karma":804,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dsh-100.png","invited_by_user":"VISIONARY","github_username":"dsmithhayes","twitter_username":"dsmithhayes"},"tags":["ask","practices"]},{"short_id":"t7drvx","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/t7drvx","created_at":"2023-05-15T20:32:50.000-05:00","title":"ES2023 introduces new array copying methods to JavaScript","url":"https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/es2023-new-array-copying-methods-javascript/","score":14,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/t7drvx/es2023_introduces_new_array_copying","submitter_user":{"username":"philnash","created_at":"2017-06-15T10:49:41.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Developer advocate for Sonar I write JavaScript and Ruby.
