Specifically, Section 6.3 presents evaluation on a\ncollection of reasoning tasks, which require multi-step mathematical or common sense reasoning to\nproduce the correct answer. Prior state-of-the-art results use a combination of task-specific fine tuning,\ndomain-specific architectures, and task-specific verifiers to achieve strong results. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that when model scaling is combined with chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b),\nsimple few-shot evaluation can outperform or match the fine tuned state of the art on a wide array of\nreasoning tasks. In Section 6.2 we additionally highlight breakthrough performance on BIG-bench (BIG-\nbench collaboration, 2021), a recently released suite of 150+ new language understanding and generation\ntasks, many of which are extremely difficult even for humans to correctly answer. In Figure 1 and\nSection 9, we demonstrate exploratory capabilities in PaLM’s ability to explicitly interpret and explain\ncomplex reasoning chains.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/36lax1/palm_scaling_language_modeling_with","submitter_user":{"username":"danilafe","created_at":"2019-11-07T17:21:18.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"CS M.S. student interested in PLT, compilers, and much more.","is_moderator":false,"karma":504,"avatar_url":"/avatars/danilafe-100.png","invited_by_user":"shapr","github_username":"DanilaFe"},"tags":["ai","pdf"]},{"short_id":"s1iayw","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/s1iayw","created_at":"2022-04-06T03:33:02.000-05:00","title":"Breaking PCBs for Science - News - SparkFun Electronics","url":"https://www.sparkfun.com/news/4400","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/s1iayw/breaking_pcbs_for_science_news_sparkfun","submitter_user":{"username":"fwg","created_at":"2013-01-02T06:39:25.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Bobcat writing code for a living.","is_moderator":false,"karma":187,"avatar_url":"/avatars/fwg-100.png","invited_by_user":"puffnfresh"},"tags":["hardware"]},{"short_id":"1lpkz2","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/1lpkz2","created_at":"2022-04-06T00:22:28.000-05:00","title":"σ-driven project management: when is the optimal time to give up?","url":"https://erikbern.com/2022/04/05/sigma-driven-project-management-when-is-the-optimal-time-to-give-up.html","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/1lpkz2/driven_project_management_when_is","submitter_user":{"username":"jamesmacaulay","created_at":"2012-11-02T15:22:58.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":234,"avatar_url":"/avatars/jamesmacaulay-100.png","invited_by_user":"julie","github_username":"jamesmacaulay","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"jamesmacaulay","sig_hash":"fbede42805529ccd49e0eaa33d1a1a75b74c6e8bd53b672cc2a5b01a1fd0f9750f"}]},"tags":["math","practices"]},{"short_id":"nga9mu","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/nga9mu","created_at":"2022-04-06T00:12:22.000-05:00","title":"Why Don't More Languages Offer Flow Typing?","url":"https://ayazhafiz.com/articles/22/why-dont-more-languages-offer-flow-typing","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/nga9mu/why_don_t_more_languages_offer_flow_typing","submitter_user":{"username":"Hail_Spacecake","created_at":"2016-06-07T16:07:14.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Programmer by trade and avocation in the SF Bay Area.
