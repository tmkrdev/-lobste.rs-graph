My research has mostly been on AI \u0026 games, both games as a testbed for AI and AI for game design. I'm also interested in other kinds of human/machine co-creation, computationally modeling design spaces, and history of technology. Currently an academic in Washington, D.C. (previously: Cornwall, Copenhagen, Santa Cruz, Atlanta, ...).\r\n\r\nWebsite: [kmjn.org](http://www.kmjn.org/)","is_moderator":false,"karma":6957,"avatar_url":"/avatars/mjn-100.png","invited_by_user":"itistoday","twitter_username":"mm_jj_nn"},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["web"]},{"short_id":"vwjfzw","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vwjfzw","created_at":"2024-01-25T15:33:30.000-06:00","title":"Fixing the hiss on my Pinball machine including root access","url":"http://raymii.org/s/software/Fixing_the_buzz_hiss_on_my_atgames_legends_pinball_micro.html","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vwjfzw/fixing_hiss_on_my_pinball_machine","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"🐋\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":24882,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"user_is_author":true,"tags":["hardware","linux"]},{"short_id":"ctdzqu","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ctdzqu","created_at":"2024-01-25T15:15:17.000-06:00","title":"shipp: Deadly simple package manager for your C/C++ projects, written in Rust","url":"https://github.com/linkdd/shipp","score":9,"flags":0,"comment_count":29,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ctdzqu/shipp_deadly_simple_package_manager_for","submitter_user":{"username":"linkdd","created_at":"2023-06-22T15:00:49.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"\u003e Je suis tombé dans l'informatique étant petit, et les effets sont devenus permanent.\r\n\r\nI'm a developer who believes that any line of code merged in master/main is \"legacy\".\r\n\r\nYet, I still write some technical-debt as a hobby:\r\n\r\n  - https://letlang.dev\r\n  - https://kubirds.com\r\n  - https://linkdd.github.io\r\n  - https://david-delassus.medium.com","is_moderator":false,"karma":339,"avatar_url":"/avatars/linkdd-100.png","invited_by_user":"jcs","github_username":"linkdd"},"user_is_author":true,"tags":["programming"]},{"short_id":"vycrry","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vycrry","created_at":"2024-01-25T14:47:46.000-06:00","title":"The things nobody wants to pay for","url":"https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/959069/c96f34ed67a168e4/","score":12,"flags":0,"comment_count":4,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vycrry/things_nobody_wants_pay_for","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":101761,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["linux","practices"]},{"short_id":"en0a0u","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/en0a0u","created_at":"2024-01-25T13:43:22.000-06:00","title":"Axioms of Systemantics","url":"https://www.biodigitaljazz.net/blog/systemantics.html","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/en0a0u/axioms_systemantics","submitter_user":{"username":"kaycebasques","created_at":"2023-06-15T16:50:39.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":107,"avatar_url":"/avatars/kaycebasques-100.png","invited_by_user":"wrs"},"user_is_author":true,"tags":["philosophy","practices","programming","science"]}]
