However, prior research has indicated that a significant number of images in the ImageNet dataset contain watermarks, making pre-trained networks susceptible to learning artifacts such as watermark patterns within their latent spaces. In this paper, we aim to assess the extent to which popular pre-trained architectures display such behavior and to determine which classes are most affected. Additionally, we examine the impact of watermarks on the extracted features. Contrary to the popular belief that the Chinese logographic watermarks impact the “carton” class only, our analysis reveals that a variety of ImageNet classes, such as “monitor”, “broom”, “apron” and “safe” rely on spurious correlations.

To the best of our knowledge, our proposed approach is the first attempt to investigate gain competition attacks as a security threat in optical NoCs. We model the attack and analyze its effects on optical NoC performance. We also propose potential attack detection techniques and countermeasures to mitigate the attack. Our experimental evaluation using different NoC topologies and diverse traffic patterns demonstrates the effectiveness of our modeling and exploration of gain competition attacks in optical NoC architectures.\r\n\r\n[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01550)","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/byivq1/modeling_exploration_gain_competition","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":95984,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["hardware","pdf","security"]},{"short_id":"eo34qk","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/eo34qk","created_at":"2023-03-11T21:47:59.000-06:00","title":"Exploiting Input Sanitization for Regex Denial of Service","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01996","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"\u003cp\u003eWeb services use server-side input sanitization to guard against harmful input.
