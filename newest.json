Happy to share what‚Äôve been working on with Thin Backend over the last months.\nThin is a version of the IHP Framework, designed to be used by frontend developers. Instead of building APIs with low-level \u003ccode\u003efetch\u003c/code\u003e calls, we provide high-level APIs like \u003ccode\u003ecreateRecord('tasks', { title: 'Hello World' }\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eupdateRecord(..)\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003edeleteRecord(..)\u003c/code\u003e to update your database. If you got a few minutes, check this demo video where I give a short introduction into the tool \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jj19fpkd2c\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jj19fpkd2c\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThin automatically generates TypeScript type definitions based on the Postgresql Schema. You can install these into your project via npm and then get really nice autocompletion and code in a much more safe way. Here‚Äôs a gif showing the autocompletion: \u003ca href=\"https://thin.dev/startpage/autocomplete30.gif\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://thin.dev/startpage/autocomplete30.gif\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo simplify state management (which is typically hard and lot‚Äôs of boilerplate), we provide realtime APIs so that all app state is always in sync with the actual database. Previously your react app might have been rendered from the redux state, now it‚Äôs rendered directly from the server state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThin actually makes the new database records etc. visible already even before the server has responded (that‚Äôs meant with optimistic updates).

Happy to share what've been working on with Thin Backend over the last months.\r\nThin is a version of the IHP Framework, designed to be used by frontend developers. Instead of building APIs with low-level `fetch` calls, we provide high-level APIs like `createRecord('tasks', { title: 'Hello World' }`, `updateRecord(..)` and `deleteRecord(..)` to update your database. If you got a few minutes, check this demo video where I give a short introduction into the tool https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jj19fpkd2c\r\n\r\nThin automatically generates TypeScript type definitions based on the Postgresql Schema. You can install these into your project via npm and then get really nice autocompletion and code in a much more safe way. Here's a gif showing the autocompletion: https://thin.dev/startpage/autocomplete30.gif\r\n\r\nTo simplify state management (which is typically hard and lot's of boilerplate), we provide realtime APIs so that all app state is always in sync with the actual database. Previously your react app might have been rendered from the redux state, now it's rendered directly from the server state.\r\n\r\nThin actually makes the new database records etc. visible already even before the server has responded (that's meant with optimistic updates). This allows for a super fast user experience even when there's a couple 100ms's of network latency.\r\n\r\nHere‚Äôs an example of a simple todo list app built with Thin + React:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction Tasks() {\r\n    const tasks = useQuery(query('tasks').orderBy('createdAt'));\r\n\r\n    return \u003cdiv\u003e\r\n        {tasks.map(task =\u003e \u003cTask task={task} key={task.id} /\u003e)}\r\n\r\n        \u003cNewTaskButton /\u003e\r\n    \u003c/div\u003e\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Task({ task }) {\r\n    const editTask = () =\u003e {\r\n        updateRecord('tasks', task.id, {\r\n            title: window.prompt('Enter new title') || ''\r\n        })\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    return \u003cdiv onDoubleClick={editTask}\u003e\r\n        {task.title}\r\n    \u003c/div\u003e\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction NewTaskButton() {\r\n    const addTask = () =\u003e {\r\n        createRecord('tasks', {\r\n            title: window.prompt('Enter title') || ''\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return \u003cbutton onClick={addTask}\u003eAdd Task\u003c/button\u003e\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Schema Designer and the migration tools make it really easy to get going with a project.\r\n\r\nInternally Thin is built with Haskell and powered by IHP DataSync (https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/realtime-spas.html).\r\n\r\nYou can find thin on github here https://github.com/digitallyinduced/thin-backend and at http://thin.dev/\r\n\r\nHappy to hear everyone's feedback! :)","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/scs239/thin_dev_back_end_for_making_end_end","submitter_user":{"username":"mpscholten","created_at":"2020-06-23T02:15:25.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":72,"avatar_url":"/avatars/mpscholten-100.png","invited_by_user":"hendi","github_username":"mpscholten"},"tags":["api","web"]},{"short_id":"kjhwct","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/kjhwct","created_at":"2022-05-12T02:16:03.000-05:00","title":"Drizzle: the most influential software project you‚Äôve (probably) never heard of","url":"https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2022/05/10/drizzle/","score":25,"flags":0,"comment_count":12,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/kjhwct/drizzle_most_influential_software","submitter_user":{"username":"Mordo","created_at":"2015-01-29T02:48:41.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":594,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Mordo-100.png","invited_by_user":"bobbywilson0","twitter_username":"JordiMonPMM"},"tags":["practices"]}]
