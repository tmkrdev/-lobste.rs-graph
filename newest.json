I'm John. I'm a computer programmer from Australia with over 20 years commercial experience. I used to be a C# programmer in the Microsoft world but about 10 years ago I jumped ship and now I program mostly on the LAMP stack. I consider programming my craft and I endeavour to be as good at it as I possibly can be.","is_moderator":false,"karma":116,"avatar_url":"/avatars/jj5-100.png","invited_by_user":"gerikson","github_username":"jj5"},"tags":["assembly","compilers","lisp","plt","practices"]},{"short_id":"8lw2pa","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/8lw2pa","created_at":"2023-09-14T08:15:40.000-05:00","title":"On Waiting","url":"https://timkellogg.me/blog/2023/09/14/wu-wei","score":9,"flags":2,"comment_count":6,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/8lw2pa/on_waiting","submitter_user":{"username":"kellogh","created_at":"2014-01-08T17:10:46.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":2454,"avatar_url":"/avatars/kellogh-100.png","invited_by_user":"qbit","github_username":"tkellogg","twitter_username":"kellogh"},"tags":["practices"]},{"short_id":"gkwf4x","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gkwf4x","created_at":"2023-09-14T05:56:56.000-05:00","title":"Today in Email Hegemony","url":"https://www.jwz.org/blog/2023/09/today-in-email-hegemony/","score":27,"flags":1,"comment_count":8,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gkwf4x/today_email_hegemony","submitter_user":{"username":"teymour","created_at":"2021-06-01T03:07:56.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"stuck in the computer nightmare","is_moderator":false,"karma":1212,"avatar_url":"/avatars/teymour-100.png","invited_by_user":"bkolobara"},"tags":["email"]},{"short_id":"goxx8g","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/goxx8g","created_at":"2023-09-14T05:50:09.000-05:00","title":"Nue: A React/Vue/Vite/Astro alternative","url":"https://nuejs.org","score":17,"flags":0,"comment_count":26,"description":"\u003cp\u003eAuthor here.
