worked on. Short summary: word + subword embedding tables are very large. For example, if you have 2 million word embeddings and 2 million subword embeddings of 300 dimensions, the embedding table is about 4.4GiB, which is prohibitively large for many applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis post describes a simple, but effective trick to compress embedding tables inspired by Bloom filters. Rather than storing and querying (sub)words explicitly, a word and its subwords are hashed. The hashes are used to index into the embedding table and the embedding is the average of these â€˜hash embeddingsâ€™. Even though this leads to collisions, this multiple-hashing scheme makes it possible to use much smaller embedding tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/iqjolo/compact_word_vectors_with_bloom","submitter_user":{"username":"danieldk","created_at":"2015-04-07T14:06:28.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Computational linguistics (parsing, generation, neural networks) and macOS/Fedora user.\r\n\r\nFeel free to drop me an e-mail.\r\n\r\nhttp://danieldk.eu/","is_moderator":false,"karma":2892,"avatar_url":"/avatars/danieldk-100.png","invited_by_user":"trousers","github_username":"danieldk","twitter_username":"danieldekok"},"tags":["ai"]},{"short_id":"x3y5tm","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/x3y5tm","created_at":"2022-04-30T04:00:38.000-05:00","title":"Anna: A Key-Value Store For Any Scale","url":"http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2022/04/anna-key-value-store-for-any-scale.html","score":14,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/x3y5tm/anna_key_value_store_for_any_scale","submitter_user":{"username":"adaszko","created_at":"2015-02-03T15:01:47.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":728,"avatar_url":"/avatars/adaszko-100.png","invited_by_user":"bobbywilson0"},"tags":["databases","distributed"]},{"short_id":"oodeyh","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/oodeyh","created_at":"2022-04-30T03:25:11.000-05:00","title":"That time we unplugged a data center to test our disaster readiness","url":"https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/disaster-readiness-test-failover-blackhole-sjc","score":10,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/oodeyh/time_we_unplugged_data_center_test_our","submitter_user":{"username":"deejayy","created_at":"2021-07-12T16:23:45.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Mainly in frontend development (Angular), but went thru the last 25 years in IT.","is_moderator":false,"karma":188,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deejayy-100.png","invited_by_user":"indigo","github_username":"deejayy"},"tags":["scaling"]},{"short_id":"fwegpz","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fwegpz","created_at":"2022-04-30T02:15:22.000-05:00","title":"Talk Like A Systems Engineer: Yaks All The Way Down","url":"https://flameeyes.blog/2022/04/26/engineering-jargon-yaks/","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fwegpz/talk_like_systems_engineer_yaks_all_way","submitter_user":{"username":"lukegb","created_at":"2021-04-22T16:25:24.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":8,"avatar_url":"/avatars/lukegb-100.png","invited_by_user":"benjojo"},"tags":["culture","practices","programming"]},{"short_id":"upbaym","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/upbaym","created_at":"2022-04-29T21:55:20.000-05:00","title":"Paying a visit to planet BSD","url":"http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2022/04/29/bsd/","score":28,"flags":1,"comment_count":8,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/upbaym/paying_visit_planet_bsd","submitter_user":{"username":"ajdecon","created_at":"2012-09-04T12:22:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I build supercomputers.
