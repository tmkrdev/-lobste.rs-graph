Is 72 bits enough?  Should I go up to 128 bits?\u003c/p\u003e\n","description_plain":"So, just to focus this question, I don't want to touch the subject of password patterns or password generation.  Let's focus only on \"random passwords\" (for whatever that means) of a given entropy.  (In other words, let's assume there is a fool-proof function `genpwd(entropy_bits)` that generates a password with the given entropy and we'll just use whatever it spits out.)\r\n\r\nAlso, to focus even more, the intended use-case is for encrypted offline storage (which includes anything from GnuPG keys, Age encrypted files, full-disk-encryption, etc.).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the only threat we want to protect against is brute-force against the cryptographic primitives.  Furthermore say the attacker has enough hardware power (say a few millions $) and enough patience (say a few years).  And let's also assume we've reached the peak of the technology capabilities (both hardware and software).\r\n\r\n(I am well aware that by now I have waved away so many potential attack vectors that we are currently in the theoretical space...)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nGiven all that, the obvious answer is \"just use a password with at least as many entropy bits as the underlying cryptographic construct\".  (For example in the case of something based on AES-128, just use a 128 entropy bits password, passed through an at least 128 bit hash function;  key derivation with iterations isn't needed.)\r\n\r\nHowever, at the other end there is memorability which pushes the entropy down.  As a user I would prefer to use a short and memorable password (regardless of what that means), which means having fewer entropy bits.\r\n\r\nAnother complication is password derivation functions (like Argon, `scrypt`, `bcrypt`, the newer `bscrypt`, or in the worst case some variant of PBKDF) which helps us gain some entropy bits through time spent.\r\n\r\nSo my question is:  given adequate defaults for a password derivation function, how many bits of entropy do I require for my password to be practically unbreakable in my lifetime (~100 years)?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIs 64 bits enough?  Is 72 bits enough?  Should I go up to 128 bits?","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wlq6nm/where_do_we_draw_line_on_password_strength","submitter_user":{"username":"ciprian_craciun","created_at":"2022-02-14T13:47:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"IT enthusiast, from programming to operating systems, from networking to cryptography, from cloud to hardware, from Erlang to Java.","is_moderator":false,"karma":576,"avatar_url":"/avatars/ciprian_craciun-100.png","invited_by_user":"syn-ack"},"tags":["ask","security"]},{"short_id":"ld15s0","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ld15s0","created_at":"2023-01-10T13:21:46.000-06:00","title":"On QVarLengthArray and Uninitialized Storage in C++","url":"https://www.kdab.com/qvarlengtharray/","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ld15s0/on_qvarlengtharray_uninitialized","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"üêã\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":19092,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["c++"]},{"short_id":"x3nvqj","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/x3nvqj","created_at":"2023-01-10T13:05:21.000-06:00","title":"Why Fortran is a scientific powerhouse","url":"https://craftofcoding.wordpress.com/2023/01/10/why-fortran-is-a-scientific-powerhouse/","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":5,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/x3nvqj/why_fortran_is_scientific_powerhouse","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"üêã\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":19092,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["fortran"]},{"short_id":"tnnjtr","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tnnjtr","created_at":"2023-01-10T12:17:31.000-06:00","title":"APT keeps complaining that the HTTPS certificate cannot be validated?","url":"http://raymii.org/s/blog/Syncthing_apt_repo_keeps_complaining_HTTPS_certificate_could_not_be_validated.html","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tnnjtr/apt_keeps_complaining_https_certificate","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"üêã\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":19092,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["linux","security"]}]
