Please feel free to open issues or submit pull requests on the GitHub repository.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/4qsvl2/introducing_tsc_nvim_project_wide","submitter_user":{"username":"dmmulroy","created_at":"2022-10-26T16:12:46.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"TypeScript, Node, React @Skolem • prev @FormidableLabs, @MainStreet • He/Him","is_moderator":false,"karma":11,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dmmulroy-100.png","invited_by_user":"bri3d"},"tags":["vim"]},{"short_id":"9unpqz","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/9unpqz","created_at":"2023-04-24T07:42:20.000-05:00","title":"Parallel Agile: Interesting Idea – Does It Work?","url":"https://two-wrongs.com/book-review-parallel-agile.html","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/9unpqz/parallel_agile_interesting_idea_does_it","submitter_user":{"username":"kqr","created_at":"2018-12-22T04:00:08.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Page unintentionally left blank.","is_moderator":false,"karma":873,"avatar_url":"/avatars/kqr-100.png","invited_by_user":"duclare"},"tags":["practices"]},{"short_id":"bc1cwg","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bc1cwg","created_at":"2023-04-24T07:16:53.000-05:00","title":"Our Journey from SaaS to OSS: Monoliths vs. Microservices","url":"https://www.appsmith.com/blog/monoliths-vs-microservices-1","score":5,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bc1cwg/our_journey_from_saas_oss_monoliths_vs","submitter_user":{"username":"mohanarpit","created_at":"2023-04-24T07:13:33.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"CTO @Appsmith","is_moderator":false,"karma":4,"avatar_url":"/avatars/mohanarpit-100.png","invited_by_user":"rishabhkaul"},"tags":["scaling"]}]
