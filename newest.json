If you‚Äôre working on a desktop, the solution might be simple - install a global hotkey which launches your software of choice regardless of scope with new document, write your stream of consciousness down, get back to work, done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not always at my desktop, recently started to be more ‚Äúoffline‚Äù which has some nice outcomes but not this. And when I don‚Äôt somehow bookmark my ideas, searches, reminders or something else in a quick manner, I might lost it. Sometimes that comes back after few hours/days but it‚Äôs not guaranteed. For some people that might sound like memory issues, but I‚Äôm pretty much sure about lot of neurodivergent/ADD/ASD/ADHD people here will feel me right now. Even more when I add the fact that event of ‚Äúlosing‚Äù the trail of information is clearly noticeable and irritates me very often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key is minimizing time to store / cache information on reliable storage medium to recall it later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, we get to the point. \u003cstrong\u003eWhich hardware combo should you use to dump your information stream?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might of course think about smartphones, and for majority that would be correct. Just make a shortcut on homescreen with your notes app of choice, or even direct intent/deeplink to create new one. But it doesn‚Äôt do much for me - I don‚Äôt like typing on smartphones, my hands are big and touch keyboards don‚Äôt work with me so well. Mix that with the fact I‚Äôm not using English exclusively and while my native language has Latin alphabet it also has its own set of diacritics and suggestions/autocorrect isn‚Äôt so well calibrated. Plus the whole flow isn‚Äôt so smooth, I often find touch keyboards adding a considerable input lag compared to my desktop, even on top notch smartphones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother option would be a paper + OCR. That‚Äôs also nice and wins on many levels including no need for battery power. But my handwriting isn‚Äôt OCRable at all and due to being left-handed it‚Äôs a little too hard to change that. I was thinking about iPad Mini + Apple Pencil, but the ecosystem of ‚Äúnotebook‚Äù apps with handwriting recognition is so messy I don‚Äôt even know where to start. And while few of these support my language, it‚Äôs still a very rough experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was also thinking about ‚Äúsome device with keyboard‚Äù as a last resort. That might be actually convincing, but there‚Äôs almost zero new handhelds with keyboard in 2020s.

If you're working on a desktop, the solution might be simple - install a global hotkey which launches your software of choice regardless of scope with new document, write your stream of consciousness down, get back to work, done.\r\n\r\nI am not always at my desktop, recently started to be more \"offline\" which has some nice outcomes but not this. And when I don't somehow bookmark my ideas, searches, reminders or something else in a quick manner, I might lost it. Sometimes that comes back after few hours/days but it's not guaranteed. For some people that might sound like memory issues, but I'm pretty much sure about lot of neurodivergent/ADD/ASD/ADHD people here will feel me right now. Even more when I add the fact that event of \"losing\" the trail of information is clearly noticeable and irritates me very often.\r\n\r\nThe key is minimizing time to store / cache information on reliable storage medium to recall it later.\r\n\r\nSo, we get to the point. **Which hardware combo should you use to dump your information stream?**\r\n\r\n* You might of course think about smartphones, and for majority that would be correct. Just make a shortcut on homescreen with your notes app of choice, or even direct intent/deeplink to create new one. But it doesn't do much for me - I don't like typing on smartphones, my hands are big and touch keyboards don't work with me so well. Mix that with the fact I'm not using English exclusively and while my native language has Latin alphabet it also has its own set of diacritics and suggestions/autocorrect isn't so well calibrated. Plus the whole flow isn't so smooth, I often find touch keyboards adding a considerable input lag compared to my desktop, even on top notch smartphones.\r\n\r\n* Another option would be a paper + OCR. That's also nice and wins on many levels including no need for battery power. But my handwriting isn't OCRable at all and due to being left-handed it's a little too hard to change that. I was thinking about iPad Mini + Apple Pencil, but the ecosystem of \"notebook\" apps with handwriting recognition is so messy I don't even know where to start. And while few of these support my language, it's still a very rough experience.\r\n\r\n* I was also thinking about \"some device with keyboard\" as a last resort. That might be actually convincing, but there's almost zero new handhelds with keyboard in 2020s. Tablets are nice and work well, but not when you want to pull the thing out of your pocked, spawn the editor and type stuff without looking too weird and distracting, all of that in less than 10 seconds.\r\n\r\n* At the point of desperation I was even considering getting an old-school clamshell device like [HP Jornada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jornada_(PDA)), [Sharp Zaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_Zaurus) or similar. These would be nice, many of them can run Linux and I don't care about online sync as long as I could dock them at home once a day to exchange data in old-school \"sync\" fashion.
