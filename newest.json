GDlog is powered by a novel range-indexed SIMD datastructure: the hash-indexed sorted array (HISA). We perform extensive evaluation on GDlog, comparing it against both CPU and GPU-based hash tables and Datalog engines, and using it to support a range of large-scale deductive queries including reachability, same generation, and context-sensitive program analysis. Our experiments show that GDlog achieves performance competitive with modern SIMD hash tables and beats prior work by an order of magnitude in runtime while offering more favorable memory footprint.\r\n\r\n[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02206), [Source](https://github.com/harp-lab/gdlog)","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/p6oek6/gdlog_gpu_accelerated_deductive_engine","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":100603,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["compsci","pdf"]},{"short_id":"q26ap9","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/q26ap9","created_at":"2023-11-29T20:55:06.000-06:00","title":"NixOS/nixpkgs 23.11","url":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/23.11","score":43,"flags":0,"comment_count":13,"description":"\u003cp\u003eAlternative URLs:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/release-notes#sec-release-23.11\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eRelease notes\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://nixos.org/blog/announcements.html#nixos-23.11\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eAnnouncement\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/releases/tag/23.11\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eTag description\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/258640\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eRelease schedule\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n","description_plain":"Alternative URLs:\r\n\r\n- [Release notes](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/release-notes#sec-release-23.11)\r\n- [Announcement](https://nixos.org/blog/announcements.html#nixos-23.11)\r\n- [Tag description](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/releases/tag/23.11)\r\n- [Release schedule](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/258640)","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/q26ap9/nixos_nixpkgs_23_11","submitter_user":{"username":"l0b0","created_at":"2022-02-14T02:54:31.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Open source developer.","is_moderator":false,"karma":1549,"avatar_url":"/avatars/l0b0-100.png","invited_by_user":"gerikson","github_username":"l0b0"},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["nix","release"]},{"short_id":"piyykx","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/piyykx","created_at":"2023-11-29T20:51:25.000-06:00","title":"Browsing the Eastern Side of the Personal Web","url":"https://www.bikobatanari.art/posts/2023/east-west-website-culture","score":15,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/piyykx/browsing_eastern_side_personal_web","submitter_user":{"username":"classichasclass","created_at":"2018-11-05T18:45:47.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"no you're off topic","is_moderator":false,"karma":3538,"avatar_url":"/avatars/classichasclass-100.png","invited_by_user":"sevan"},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["web"]},{"short_id":"3nqxpa","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/3nqxpa","created_at":"2023-11-29T20:06:56.000-06:00","title":"Nonblocking cycle detection and iterator invalidation","url":"https://outerproduct.net/trivial/2023-11-29_nonblocking-cycles.html","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/3nqxpa/nonblocking_cycle_detection_iterator","submitter_user":{"username":"Moonchild","created_at":"2018-04-01T12:28:59.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":3244,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Moonchild-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx"},"user_is_author":true,"tags":["api"]},{"short_id":"fooexk","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fooexk","created_at":"2023-11-29T18:08:06.000-06:00","title":"On the same platform directly opposite?","url":"https://stuebinm.eu/posts/am-selben-bahnsteig-gegen%C3%BCber.html","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fooexk/on_same_platform_directly_opposite","submitter_user":{"username":"LeahNeukirchen","created_at":"2012-11-15T17:05:29.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://leahneukirchen.org\r\nhttps://blahaj.social/@leah","is_moderator":false,"karma":1548,"avatar_url":"/avatars/LeahNeukirchen-100.png","invited_by_user":"MSch"},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["databases"]}]
