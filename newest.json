Do we have a theory for these decisions, or are they just heuristic-based? In the latter case, can we achieve better performance/fairness by implementing some data-driven decision-making or stochastic control algorithms with [eBPF](https://lwn.net/Articles/941614/)? On the application level, I'm thinking about SQL databases, whose interaction with the network or filesystem could probably use some optimization from queuing theory, but maybe that has already been done.\r\n\r\nMy ultimate goal is to make some practical algorithms or software packages that people can use, rather than doing theoretical analysis. Please tell me where can I make a difference!","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ipbeec/application_operation_research","submitter_user":{"username":"nalzok","created_at":"2019-06-20T08:59:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":1386,"avatar_url":"/avatars/nalzok-100.png","invited_by_user":"WilhelmVonWeiner","github_username":"nalzok","twitter_username":"fixed_bug","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"nalzok","sig_hash":"dfe65412a3e7fa28e06a07a9dc2c824b14032f40c58b3c4bac3f00bd837570bb0f"}]},"tags":["ask","compsci"]},{"short_id":"keot20","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/keot20","created_at":"2023-09-14T12:48:30.000-05:00","title":"Make Member Function const and Global Function Static in Visual Studio","url":"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/make-member-function-const-and-global-function-static-in-visual-studio/","score":1,"flags":1,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/keot20/make_member_function_const_global","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"🐋\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":23068,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["c++"]},{"short_id":"psyt6b","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/psyt6b","created_at":"2023-09-14T10:43:45.000-05:00","title":"Understanding Wasm, Part 3: You Are Here","url":"https://www.neversaw.us/2023/09/04/understanding-wasm/part3/you-are-here/","score":10,"flags":0,"comment_count":3,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/psyt6b/understanding_wasm_part_3_you_are_here","submitter_user":{"username":"ansemjo","created_at":"2023-07-18T15:25:27.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"find me on github, twitter or chaos.social under this name","is_moderator":false,"karma":10,"avatar_url":"/avatars/ansemjo-100.png","invited_by_user":"geerlingguy"},"tags":["virtualization","wasm"]}]
