Around this time RedHat acquired CentOS, which was a bug-for-bug clone of RHEL and matched its release cycle at the time, which was perfectly fine because RHEL is just a collection of packaging and patches they‚Äôve created for GPL-licensed software (and other free licenses).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen in about this time of year in 2019, a little over four years ago to the day, IBM purchased RedHat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen in 2020, RedHat announced it was going to nuke the release cycle CentOS had been using to introduce CentOS stream, so that it would have a rolling release cycle and would no longer be bug-for-bug compatible with RHEL. The last supported release of CentOS goes end of life in 2024. At the time they made some statements about the reason why being about shortening the development cycle for RHEL by using CentOS as its testing stage, which most people actually believed at the time (this was in response to community criticism about it appearing to be an anti-competitive measure and an attack on open source projects).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few people were picking up on where this was headed, and decided to create CentOS clones to match RHEL‚Äôs release cycle and provide a community version that was bug-for-bug compatible. Two notable examples are AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux. Since IBM‚Äôs RedHat had claimed the CentOS change was about optimizing the development lifecycle for RHEL, this should seem to be irrelevant to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept, it wasn‚Äôt about that at all once those projects got large. Four years later, almost to the day, IBM‚Äôs RedHat has announced that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit will no longer be making publicly accessible the source code for RHEL\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethat source code will be distributed only to paying customers in a walled garden model\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe subscription agreement will forbid subscribers from building a RHEL clone or publishing the GPL‚Äì licensed software they were being given access to.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich has these impacts on those RHEL bug-for-bug clones:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethey can no longer get access to the source code for RHEL to build the bug-for-bug clone\nthis includes security patches\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edevelopers who write security patches in these communities, should they choose to submit their patches upstream, will no longer be able to access their own patches for inclusion in their own distribution without violating the RHEL subscription terms\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey seem to operate on a four year cycle and I have identified a way around this barrier they‚Äôve put around all these downstream communities.

Around this time RedHat acquired CentOS, which was a bug-for-bug clone of RHEL and matched its release cycle at the time, which was perfectly fine because RHEL is just a collection of packaging and patches they‚Äôve created for GPL-licensed software (and other free licenses).\r\n\r\nThen in about this time of year in 2019, a little over four years ago to the day, IBM purchased RedHat.\r\n\r\nThen in 2020, RedHat announced it was going to nuke the release cycle CentOS had been using to introduce CentOS stream, so that it would have a rolling release cycle and would no longer be bug-for-bug compatible with RHEL. The last supported release of CentOS goes end of life in 2024. At the time they made some statements about the reason why being about shortening the development cycle for RHEL by using CentOS as its testing stage, which most people actually believed at the time (this was in response to community criticism about it appearing to be an anti-competitive measure and an attack on open source projects).\r\n\r\nA few people were picking up on where this was headed, and decided to create CentOS clones to match RHEL‚Äôs release cycle and provide a community version that was bug-for-bug compatible. Two notable examples are AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux. Since IBM‚Äôs RedHat had claimed the CentOS change was about optimizing the development lifecycle for RHEL, this should seem to be irrelevant to them.\r\n\r\nExcept, it wasn‚Äôt about that at all once those projects got large.
