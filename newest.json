Kildaire (or deavmi on the Internet) and I‚Äôm a computer programmer. I love tinkering around with all the bits of software that my computer runs but typically more on the low-level sides of things. I‚Äôm really interested in how operating systems work as a whole and their components such as kernels, networking stacks, linking-loaders, IPC, paging, virtual memory, file-systems and the list goes on. There‚Äôs so much to learn from understanding these complex systems and each aspect of them never leaves me bored!\r\n\r\nYou could call me a language enthusiast, from the design to the implementation. I always want to know how things work and I‚Äôve even spent time reading the source code for some language runtimes to get a better understanding. If I am feeling creative then I try write my own or write something in Forth! I love building networks too - I have an interest in setting up inter-networks with routing protocols, assigning numbers and setting up tunnels in order to build a huge network that I can play around on. When I‚Äôm not using other peoples' protocols I am busy writing my own to see what I can cobble out to itch my scratch on trying interesting concepts out.\r\n\r\nI like a good glass of red wine and cheese. I have an avid enjoyment for music from the 70s and the 80s and have rather interesting political views (nothing to be alarmed of) but most importantly I like to help others learn and put a smile on their face.","is_moderator":false,"karma":54,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deavmi-100.png","invited_by_user":"duclare","github_username":"deavmi","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"tristankildaire","sig_hash":"4397ec164f1a65b7fd0803bc85cd0b12d06cb2606c2ae0a27795dd90e98e219c0f"}]},"tags":["graphics","linux"]},{"short_id":"omwbk8","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/omwbk8","created_at":"2023-01-08T09:00:21.000-06:00","title":"There Is No Software Maintenance","url":"https://henrikwarne.com/2023/01/07/there-is-no-software-maintenance/","score":9,"flags":0,"comment_count":11,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/omwbk8/there_is_no_software_maintenance","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"üêã\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":19072,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["practices"]},{"short_id":"sqi2xq","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/sqi2xq","created_at":"2023-01-08T02:32:55.000-06:00","title":"Ideas For A Javascript Stricter Mode","url":"https://rtpg.co/2023/01/08/ideas-for-a-javascript-stricter-mode.html","score":9,"flags":0,"comment_count":17,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/sqi2xq/ideas_for_javascript_stricter_mode","submitter_user":{"username":"rtpg","created_at":"2016-07-06T05:00:24.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":2896,"avatar_url":"/avatars/rtpg-100.png","invited_by_user":"BruceM"},"tags":["javascript"]},{"short_id":"iy5wlx","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/iy5wlx","created_at":"2023-01-08T01:16:47.000-06:00","title":"The beauty of CGI and simple design, by Hales","url":"https://rubenerd.com/the-beauty-of-cgi-and-simple-design-by-hales/","score":8,"flags":0,"comment_count":5,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/iy5wlx/beauty_cgi_simple_design_by_hales","submitter_user":{"username":"emilengler","created_at":"2021-01-27T10:53:27.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Software Engineering | Free Software | üê°","is_moderator":false,"karma":384,"avatar_url":"/avatars/emilengler-100.png","invited_by_user":"awesomekling","github_username":"emilengler"},"tags":["web"]},{"short_id":"ohyrmq","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ohyrmq","created_at":"2023-01-07T22:19:58.000-06:00","title":"SDL2 common mistakes and how to avoid them","url":"https://nullprogram.com/blog/2023/01/08/","score":21,"flags":0,"comment_count":5,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ohyrmq/sdl2_common_mistakes_how_avoid_them","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":94889,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["api","c"]}]
