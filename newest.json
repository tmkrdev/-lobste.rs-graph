Such hybrid attacks are an emerging threat that can bypass countermeasures for traditional microarchitectural side-channel attacks.\r\n\r\nGiven the rise in popularity of both Arm SoCs and GPUs, in this paper we investigate the susceptibility of these devices to information leakage via power, temperature and frequency, as measured via internal sensors. We demonstrate that the sensor data observed correlates with both instructions executed and data processed, allowing us to mount software-visible hybrid side-channel attacks on these devices.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the real-world impact of this issue, we present JavaScript-based pixel stealing and history sniffing attacks on Chrome and Safari, with all side channel countermeasures enabled. Finally, we also show website fingerprinting attacks, without any elevated privileges. \r\n\r\n[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12784)","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/lt6u9e/hot_pixels_frequency_power_temperature","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":96957,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["hardware","pdf","security"]},{"short_id":"tfrtrd","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tfrtrd","created_at":"2023-05-23T08:25:04.000-05:00","title":"Why I Use Elm in 2023","url":"https://taylor.town/elm-2023","score":20,"flags":0,"comment_count":15,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tfrtrd/why_i_use_elm_2023","submitter_user":{"username":"restrictedchoice","created_at":"2020-01-16T12:27:56.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":247,"avatar_url":"/avatars/restrictedchoice-100.png","invited_by_user":"pgr0ss"},"tags":["elm"]},{"short_id":"ej0lra","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ej0lra","created_at":"2023-05-23T07:17:26.000-05:00","title":"Introducing Pins: Permanent Nix Binary Storage","url":"https://blog.cachix.org/posts/2023-05-23-introducing-pins-permanent-nix-binary-storage/","score":17,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ej0lra/introducing_pins_permanent_nix_binary","submitter_user":{"username":"domenkozar","created_at":"2022-11-17T11:54:50.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Creator of https://cachix.org, https://devenv.sh and https://nix.dev","is_moderator":false,"karma":194,"avatar_url":"/avatars/domenkozar-100.png","invited_by_user":"anmonteiro"},"tags":["nix"]}]
