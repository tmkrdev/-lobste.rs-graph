From this, we produce a novel taxonomy for classifying and analyzing these threats, and elaborate on how different side channels (e.g. visual, thermal, acoustic, power, and magnetic) may be used to either enhance the impact of a given Trojan or utilized as part of a defensive strategy. Other defenses are also presented -- including hardware, web-, and software-related. To conclude, we discuss seven different case studies and elaborate how they fit into our taxonomy. Overall, this paper presents a detailed survey of the Trojan landscape for Digital Manufacturing: threats, defenses, and the importance of implementing secure practices. \r\n\r\n[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10336)","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/jsoics/survey_digital_manufacturing_hardware","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":95250,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["pdf","security"]},{"short_id":"mbchar","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mbchar","created_at":"2023-01-26T15:11:39.000-06:00","title":"Post to email: supporting contact forms for static websites","url":"https://github.com/matthiasmullie/post-to-email","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":13,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mbchar/post_email_supporting_contact_forms_for","submitter_user":{"username":"matthiasmullie","created_at":"2014-11-21T12:51:09.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":11,"avatar_url":"/avatars/matthiasmullie-100.png","invited_by_user":"JeremyMorgan"},"tags":["email","php","release","web"]},{"short_id":"8mnx1e","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/8mnx1e","created_at":"2023-01-26T14:27:35.000-06:00","title":"Fallible - The Lost Sibling of Result and Option","url":"https://datavirke.dk/posts/fallible-missing-rust-error-handling/","score":10,"flags":0,"comment_count":6,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/8mnx1e/fallible_lost_sibling_result_option","submitter_user":{"username":"robey","created_at":"2013-12-19T22:12:04.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Hi, I'm Robey.
