(I also use that 30 GB hard drive as a \"bucket\" to avoid any cloud storage fees for images, etc.) Here is a 3 min demo of the framework:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU6-BTxQoCA","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/uteqkq/video_demo_go_on_rails_framework","submitter_user":{"username":"andrewfromx","created_at":"2016-10-02T18:31:36.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewarrow","is_moderator":false,"karma":142,"avatar_url":"/avatars/andrewfromx-100.png","invited_by_user":"friendlysock"},"tags":["go","video"]},{"short_id":"xlkow8","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xlkow8","created_at":"2023-09-09T10:45:53.000-05:00","title":"Countering string bloat","url":"https://www.volkerkrause.eu/2023/09/09/qt-string-bloat.html","score":9,"flags":0,"comment_count":3,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xlkow8/countering_string_bloat","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"🐋\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":23037,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["c++"]},{"short_id":"okwucm","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/okwucm","created_at":"2023-09-09T10:30:41.000-05:00","title":"Design and Implementation of an Object-Oriented Functional Language","url":"https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10107565/1/Design_and_implementation_of_a.pdf","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/okwucm/design_implementation_object_oriented","submitter_user":{"username":"vector_spaces","created_at":"2020-01-28T00:07:17.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":380,"avatar_url":"/avatars/vector_spaces-100.png","invited_by_user":"bandali"},"tags":["compilers","pdf","plt"]}]
