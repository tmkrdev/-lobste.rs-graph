As a little spoiler I’ll add that the new Swift 5.9 Macro system and Template Haskell go a looong way.\r\n\r\nHappy to have your feedback,\r\nRodrigo","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wd4d0f/creating_macos_app_with_haskell_swift","submitter_user":{"username":"romes","created_at":"2023-07-10T15:45:28.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"A contributor to the Glasgow Haskell Compiler\r\n\r\nWebsite: alt-romes.github.io","is_moderator":false,"karma":30,"avatar_url":"/avatars/romes-100.png","invited_by_user":"bgamari","github_username":"alt-romes"},"user_is_author":true,"tags":["compilers","haskell","mac","swift"]},{"short_id":"kb17d5","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/kb17d5","created_at":"2023-11-23T00:58:17.000-06:00","title":"Herbie: Find and fix floating-point accuracy problems","url":"https://herbie.uwplse.org/","score":15,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/kb17d5/herbie_find_fix_floating_point_accuracy","submitter_user":{"username":"epilys","created_at":"2017-05-09T09:29:51.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Virtualization and Emulation Engineer at Linaro.\r\n\r\nMaintainer of [`meli`](https://github.com/meli/meli), a terminal e-mail client.\r\n\r\nMastodon: https://chaos.social/@epilys","is_moderator":false,"karma":1866,"avatar_url":"/avatars/epilys-100.png","invited_by_user":"river","github_username":"epilys"},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["compsci","math"]},{"short_id":"irexg6","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/irexg6","created_at":"2023-11-22T23:32:56.000-06:00","title":"Bug Bounties Tips from the Triager","url":"https://mike-sheward.medium.com/bug-bounties-tips-from-the-triager-7cb092efd22a","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/irexg6/bug_bounties_tips_from_triager","submitter_user":{"username":"freddyb","created_at":"2017-02-02T09:12:16.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I like browser security and web security.
