Happy to hear any feedback or guidance on how to improve this!\u003c/p\u003e\n","description_plain":"Hi folks! Perhaps a bit of an odd post but wanted to reach out to get some feedback from the Rust fellows in the community. I'm writing a toy work pool/supervisor library, [poolparty](https://github.com/JuxhinDB/poolparty?tab=readme-ov-file), inspired by Erlang's [`poolboy`](https://github.com/devinus/poolboy). Everything is effectively a back-of-the-napkin sketch but have some areas I'd like some guidance with.\r\n\r\nWe have a concept of a [`Worker`](https://github.com/JuxhinDB/poolparty/blob/main/src/worker.rs) trait that library-users can implement to encapsulate some workload (e.g., perform inference against some dataset). \r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub trait Workable: Debug + Send + Sync + Sized {\r\n    type Task: Task + Debug;\r\n    type Output: Debug + Send;\r\n    type Error: Debug + Send;\r\n\r\n    fn process(task: Self::Task) -\u003e impl Future\u003cOutput = Response\u003cSelf\u003e\u003e;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a library, I'd like to hide away all the state-machinery and the running of the worker. Specifically how it receives messages from the supervisor, changes state, propagates results and handles errors (outside of the task context).\r\n\r\nAfter reading a few posts on state-machines in Rust, some more complex than others, there are a few requirements I had:\r\n\r\n* State transitions do not need to be checked at compile-time\r\n* Transitions may need to accept event inputs (e.g., a Task to run)\r\n* Transitions should not block the task, as we still need to be able to receive events from the supervisor during a long transition (e.g., while running a task, we receive a `cancel` event) and must gracefully cancel and transition to `idle`.\r\n\r\nThe idea I have so far is a simple `State` enum that is packed into the `Worker` struct, which is a wrapper struct around the `Workable` trait.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Debug)]\r\nenum State\u003cW: Workable\u003e {\r\n    Idle,\r\n    Running { task: W::Task },\r\n    Error(W::Error),\r\n    Stop,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Worker` struct containing the state.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub struct Worker\u003c'a, W: Workable\u003e {\r\n    id: usize,\r\n    rx: Receiver\u003cRequest\u003cW\u003e\u003e,\r\n    state: State\u003cW\u003e,\r\n    worker: PhantomData\u003c\u0026'a W\u003e, // Ignore\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd implementing the state transitions by implementing the `State` enum on the generic `Worker\u003cW\u003e`.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl\u003cW: Workable\u003e State\u003cW\u003e {\r\n    // NOTE(jdb): The following is the initial state machine for workers.\r\n    //\r\n    //                           complete/success\r\n    //                           cancel\r\n    //              ┌───────────────────────────────┐\r\n    //              │                               │\r\n    //         ┌────▼─────┐                   ┌─────┴─────┐\r\n    //       ┌─┤          │      task         │           │\r\n    // cancel│ │   IDLE   ├───────────────────►  RUNNING  │\r\n    //       └─►          │                   │           │\r\n    //         └────┬─────┘                   └───┬─┬─────┘\r\n    //              │            shutdown         │ │\r\n    //      shutdown│ ┌───────────────────────────┘ │complete/fail\r\n    //              │ │                             │\r\n    //         ┌────▼─▼───┐                   ┌─────▼─────┐\r\n    //         │          │      shutdown     │           │\r\n    //         │   STOP   ◄───────────────────┤   ERROR   │\r\n    //         │          │                   │           │\r\n    //         └──────────┘                   └───────────┘\r\n    //\r\n    //  Note that retrying should not be handled by the worker. Instead it\r\n    //  is the job of the Supervisor to determine if we should shut down\r\n    //  the worker, and spawn a new one with the same task. This is done to\r\n    //  ensure that we are able to capture error state before terminating a\r\n    //  worker.\r\n    fn next(\u0026self, event: Request\u003cW\u003e) -\u003e Result\u003cState\u003cW\u003e, String\u003e {\r\n        match (self, event) {\r\n            (State::Idle, Request::Task(t)) =\u003e Ok(State::Running { task: t }),\r\n            (State::Idle, Request::Cancel) =\u003e Ok(State::Idle),\r\n            (State::Running { task: _ }, Request::Cancel) =\u003e Ok(State::Idle),\r\n            (_, Request::Shutdown) =\u003e Ok(State::Stop),\r\n            _ =\u003e Err(\"invalid transition\".to_string()),\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis part seems _okay_. My issues are that:\r\n\r\n1. I cannot take ownership of the `Worker` struct as part of the state transition. This leads to this weird case where we need a [`\u0026mut self`](https://github.com/JuxhinDB/poolparty/blob/d384d836eee059adb11d4944e5dcbd654f00e51d/src/worker.rs#L67-L73) to update state.\r\n2. `handle_event` cannot return the [transitioned state](https://github.com/JuxhinDB/poolparty/blob/d384d836eee059adb11d4944e5dcbd654f00e51d/src/worker.rs#L75). That said, this might be overcome with a macro.\r\n\r\nAnd likely a large number of other anti-patterns.
