For example, when scanning a string I search for both double-quote and backslash. (Plus 00 if the JSON has not been validated.)\r\n\r\n- C has a function to do this, strcspn, but it’s slow.\r\n- A naive loop testing every char with several == comparisons is faster.\r\n- indexing each byte in a 256-item lookup table is still faster.\r\n- Unrolling the loop to look at 4 bytes in sequence is even faster (stole this from sa-json.)\r\n- “Homemade SIMD” by reading a uint32 or uint64 and doing bitwise tricks to detect any of those bytes is significantly slower, sadly.\r\n- [Goldilocks solution goes here]\r\n- The SIMDJSON library is super fast but has a whole bunch of complex code — it has to implement the core loops six or seven times for specific instruction sets, and then figure out at runtime which of those to call. I would rather avoid dragging all that in.\r\n\r\nYesterday I was experimenting with Apple's “simd” library, which is based on Clang vector extensions, and it does pretty well, but I am not sure if this is portable to non-Apple systems or non-Clang compilers. (GCC has its own extensions, which Clang partially supports, but when I tried those Clang generated slow non-SIMD code.)","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/9q6rnm/fast_byte_searching_with_simd_without_ton","submitter_user":{"username":"snej","created_at":"2020-01-26T19:05:30.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Mobile Architect at Couchbase.
