The largest difference is for CloverLeaf at a window size of 2000, where RISC-V has 12% less ILP available. The only case where RISC-V has more ILP at large window sizes is STREAM with a 5.8% advantage. In every case however, at lower window sizes (500 or less), RISC-V has more ILP available with AArch64 overtaking at higher window sizes.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/alk7m1/empirical_comparison_riscv_aarch64","submitter_user":{"username":"brucehoult","created_at":"2021-01-07T13:44:24.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":321,"avatar_url":"/avatars/brucehoult-100.png","invited_by_user":"indolering"},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["assembly","hardware","pdf","scaling"]},{"short_id":"u9bdri","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/u9bdri","created_at":"2023-11-14T18:21:42.000-06:00","title":"How to set desktop wallpaper on NixOS (2020)","url":"https://www.codyhiar.com/blog/how-to-set-desktop-wallpaper-on-nixos/","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/u9bdri/how_set_desktop_wallpaper_on_nixos_2020","submitter_user":{"username":"l0b0","created_at":"2022-02-14T02:54:31.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Open source developer.","is_moderator":false,"karma":1353,"avatar_url":"/avatars/l0b0-100.png","invited_by_user":"gerikson","github_username":"l0b0"},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["nix"]},{"short_id":"mjlt0h","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mjlt0h","created_at":"2023-11-14T17:33:10.000-06:00","title":"Announcing F# 8","url":"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-fsharp-8/","score":27,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mjlt0h/announcing_f_8","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":100370,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["dotnet","ml","release"]}]
