But, since ACAO * does *not* allow credentials, then that's actually safer, right? And if your backend has to expect traffic from, say, `curl`, or whatever, then you might as well acknowledge that fact fundamentally and say arbitrary JS scripts out there can also hit the endpoint (as long as, similarly to curl, they don't include a cookie). Is there a downside to this approach?\r\n\r\n* `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` - this is the truly dangerous one, since the whole threat model of CORS is about a malicious website sending an authenticated request to your server without the user's consent. So in this case, you do need to carefully set ACAO to specifically the origin that your own real site is at.\r\n\r\n* What should you do about CORP, COEP, etc - all the new headers?","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/2qr2nf/cors_is_such_mess_what_are_current_best","submitter_user":{"username":"losvedir","created_at":"2012-09-04T05:56:07.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Developer at the MBTA in Boston, primarily Elixir, but also Python and Typescript.\r\n\r\nFormerly Lead Engineer at CoachUp, a Ruby on Rails start-up in Cambridge, MA (TechStars Boston F12).\r\n\r\nFeel free to shoot me an email about anything: gabe@durazo.us.","is_moderator":false,"karma":261,"avatar_url":"/avatars/losvedir-100.png","invited_by_user":"roryokane"},"tags":["ask","browsers","security"]},{"short_id":"kxlskh","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/kxlskh","created_at":"2023-03-30T06:18:00.000-05:00","title":"Charts.css","url":"https://chartscss.org/","score":12,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/kxlskh/charts_css","submitter_user":{"username":"dz4k","created_at":"2022-12-21T15:27:51.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I'm https://denizaksimsek.com","is_moderator":false,"karma":147,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dz4k-100.png","invited_by_user":"1cg","github_username":"dz4k"},"tags":["css","visualization","web"]},{"short_id":"8xjxvp","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/8xjxvp","created_at":"2023-03-30T06:13:46.000-05:00","title":"The Truth about Rust/WebAssembly Performance","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KtotxNAwME","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/8xjxvp/truth_about_rust_webassembly","submitter_user":{"username":"bwr","created_at":"2016-05-13T14:41:43.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I'm Ben - I work on various projects aimed at improving humanity's chance of survival.\r\n\r\nI'm originally from Blacksburg, Virginia.","is_moderator":false,"karma":763,"avatar_url":"/avatars/bwr-100.png","invited_by_user":"jpo","github_username":"benwr","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"benwr","sig_hash":"7d15a6a07f0951772db7263ab6290761b3576c8ad623d77a0e8974e6dab81a840f"}]},"tags":["javascript","performance","rust","video","wasm"]}]
